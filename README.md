# 1-2-many

## About
A thesaurus application that consumes the Merriam-Webster Thesaurus API. 1-2-Many was built as a code challenge for Turing School of Sofware and Design's module 4 curriculum. Users can get a list of synonyms for a word that they chooe to search. 1-2-Many was my time writing an application in Vue.js.
